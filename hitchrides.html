  <div class="section1">
    <h6>This project was made possible because of Design for America, a national design organization that partners with universities to encourage product design projects for social good. Check them out <a href="http://designforamerica.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</h6>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>At UC San Diego, parking is limited, the roads are congested, and car-emissions are a huge problem. We found through surveys, interviews, and ethnographic studies that many university students insisted on commuted to campus using their personal cars, alone. </p>

    <h3>Our Solution</h3>
    <p>HitchRides is a mobile ride-sharing application for the students at the University of California, San Diego. It helps match students with similar schedules into ridesharing groups.</p>

    <h3>Surveys revealed that most students commuted via their personal vehicles and city buses.</h3>
    <p>To focus our problem scope, our team decided to focus on students commuting by car. Within the time constraints of our project, it wouldn’t be feasible to propose a systematic change to the San Diego bus system.</p>

    <h3>User Interviews and additional in-person surveys supported our hypothesis that most students commute alone.</h3>
    <p>Of the 20 students our team approached, 75% admitted to normally commuting alone. This data gave our team confidence that a problem did indeed exist with single-rider cars. Before we started ideating, we wanted to find out why students preferred to commute alone.</p>

    <h3>A follow-up round of surveys and interviews revealed that the main deterrent for student carpool groups is the difficulty to find students with similar schedules.</h3>
    <p>Students typically have to juggle a part-time job, class, extra-curricular clubs, and homework. Convenience is one of the biggest needs for our user group. Many students said they would be unwilling to wait for carpooling partners to leave to/from campus. 
      <br><br>
      This follow-up research helped debunk one of our initial assumptions that students might feel uncomfortable carpooling with strangers. However, many of students stated that they would feel comfortable if they knew the fellow commuter was another university student. Many of our research participants mentioned that they were part of  student ridesharing Facebook groups. However, these groups typically were used for long trips back to their family’s homes for breaks.</p>
    <h3 id="greytext">How might we facilitate student ridesharing communities by pairing students with similar schedules?</h3>

    <h6>User Flow Diagram</h6>
    <h3>Usability Testing demonstrated user drop-off in our onboarding workflow and issues with our visual design.</h3>
    <p>We found that several students got stuck and needed assistance during the sign-up flow. From our observations, it seemed like the primary actions were not discoverable.
      <br><br>
      Many students were confused about the email verification step. Many of them failed to read instructions 
      <br><br>
      We also received feedback that the visual design was “distracting” and “too loud”.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>HitchRides is not my finest work, but it was pivotal in my journey as a designer. Looking back, our project definitely could’ve been improved in many ways. However, this project was one of my first opportunities to create a truly impactful product. It was my first time creating a functioning prototype for usability testing, and HitchRides propeled my interest in Interaction Design. Here are a few of my key takeaways from this project.</p>
    <h3>Think about potential stakeholders that can support the project early on in the process.</h3>
    <p>As the saying goes, “it’s about who you know, not what you know.” I realize now that having supporting stakeholders is invaluable to a project’s success. There are opportunities to gain funding, expand research capabilities, and even hire a development team.</p>
    <h3>Test as soon as you can! Test the visual design!</h3>
    <p>The sooner you get real hands on the product, the faster you can refine the product. Our team made the huge mistake of wireframing the entire application before scheduling research sessions. Looking back, we should have held smaller, more frequent research sessions. Additionally, we should have tested our visual design. At the time, many of our team members lacked knowledge of accessibility, color contrast, and color theory. If I could do it all over again, I would have chosen a more complementary color scheme; using our primary color more sparingly. I would have also tested our visual design with reaction tests.</p>
    <h3>Create an initial concept sooner.</h3>
    <p>Our team spent A LOT of time in our discovery phase. At the time, many of us were only exposed to the traditional Design Thinking approach to product design. Now, I realize it may have been more beneficial to speed up the process and make low-risk assumptions. We spent so much time planning and narrowing our problem space that we delayed getting prototypes in the hands of students. I feel like we could have reduced a lot of the ambiguity by getting real feedback sooner.</p>
