    <h6>This is a personal case study. This project and I are not affiliated with SoundCloud in any way.</h6>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>How might I improve the efficiency of playlist creation on SoundCloud’s mobile application?</p>

    <h3>Our Solution</h3>
    <p>I updated the UI to allow users to create playlists from their Collections tab.</p>

    <h3>Surveys revealed that most music streaming applications were used on their mobile phone. The top 2 use cases for streaming applications are “finding new music” and “creating playlists”</h3>
    <p>I sent out an online survey which garnered 36 responses. My goal for this survey was to verify two of my initial assumptions…
      <br><br>
      The majority of people who use music streaming platforms are accessing these services through mobile apps, rather than the desktop application.
      <br><br>
      A top use case for music streaming platforms are curating personal playlists.</p>

    <p id="add_top_padding">While “finding new music” was the top use case, I decided to focus on improvements to playlist curation because I did not have the resources to simulate realistic/ecologically valid solutions to test. “Creating playlists” still garnered a large portion of the responses, and I would be able to create testable scenarios for my proposed solutions.</p>

    <h3>My updated user flow allowed users to create a playlist from their Collection tab. </h3>
    <p>As stated in the image above, the most common non-critical error was attempting to create a playlist from the playlist screen. I wanted to update the workflow to match users’ expectations. If they expect to create a playlist from that screen, they should be able to.</p>

    <h3>Follow-Up Usability Testing gave concrete, quantitative evidence that my updates lowered user drop-off in the playlist creation workflow.</h3>
    <p>To test my UI updates, I ran the same usability test, but with different participants.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>While this project is relatively small in scope, it demonstrates the power of agile usability testing to identify significant improvements to a feature’s user experience. This project portrays my ability to setup evaluative research to drive design decisions. In this project, I wrote a detailed research plan, decided on quantitative criteria to test my redesign against, and found objective results to support my design decisions. 
      <br><br>
      Moving forward, I would definitely love to tackle other features/use cases for the SoundCloud mobile app such as improvements to the iconography and discovery of new music.</p>
