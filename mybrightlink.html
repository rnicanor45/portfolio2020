    <h3>Project Objectives and User Needs</h3>
    <p>Our business partners at the Behavioral Health Provider Network (theBHPN) sought ways to make a more direct impact on the families that their providers service. Additionally, they wanted to streamline the communication channels between their clinical case managers (CCM’s) and the families that they coordinate care for. Lastly, they saw an opportunity to gather more feedback on their client’s sessions to improve care across the network.
      <br><br> Caregivers within the network typically feel isolated, judged, and overwhelmed. They have a lot of questions regarding their child’s diagnosis, and they don’t know which resources are credible. Caregivers hardly have any time for themselves or their family, and they’re anxious about the uncertainty of their child’s future.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Solution</h3>
    <p>MyBrightlink is an iOS and Android application developed for caregivers of autism patients receiving treatment within theBHPN. MyBrightlink gives parents access to an in-app community where they can connect for support, mentorship, advice, or even potential play dates. It also supports a secure messaging platform where they can easily get in contact with their CCM. The app also provides caregivers with an expert-curated list of local events and educational articles. After their child’s treatment sessions, they can also send feedback directly back to theBHPN to help improve the quality of their child’s care.</p>

    <h3>Focus groups helped inform our Community onboarding process and validate the benefit of an in-app community.</h3>
    <p>XOLV set up a series of focus groups within a few weeks of our project kick-off. One of the most valuable insights we received from these focus groups was that parents would like to share their personal stories and the unique challenges they face. Parents seemed to make meaningful connections through common experiences. </p>
    <h3>Fly-on-the-wall studies and focus groups revealed that parents felt isolated.</h3>
    <p>Our studies suggested that parents bonded fairly easily over shared experiences. However, when asked how often they socialized with other parents in theBHPN, many said that they rarely ever connected. Further investigation unveiled many potential reasons for this disconnect. 
      <br><br>
      Many parents felt it was hard to break the ice without any insight to another parent’s situation.
      <br><br>
      Parents are very cautious about who their child interacts with. Many parents were afraid others would misunderstand their child’s actions. For example, some children affected by ASD have a hard time verbally communicating. Even with these concerns, many parents still felt like play-dates could benefit their child in many ways.
      <br><br>
      Most of parents time is spent head down in work, researching their child’s diagnosis, and other daily activities. This leaves very little time to commit to play-dates or search for social communities of ASD parents.</p>

    <h6>Parents are able to discover other parents in the network, make connections, and message their peers.</h6>
    <h3>User research studies helped inform the content and UI copy for our Secure Messaging feature.</h3>
    <p>We conducted approximately 14 in-person studies to observe the reactions to our initial concepts. Our data determined what information we should display about the parent’s CCM.</p>
    <img src="/images/mybrightlink_4.png" alt="mybrightlink_4">
    <h3>User Interviews helped inform educational content, as well as the Interests form we included in Community onboarding.</h3>
    <p>Intentionality was extremely important when it came to delivering content. ASD affects families in different ways, so it's natural for their needs to vary greatly. For example, we spoke with a few parents who have high-functioning children, and they mentioned that they’re only interested in resources that apply to high-functioning autism. To parents who had kiddos with a more impacted diagnoses, high-functioning resources was less requested.
      <br><br>
      Another highly-requested topic/interest was information on Individualized Educational Programs (IEPs). Our interviews revealed many of the big questions parents had (i.e. Puberty, Occupational Skill Building, Respite Care, etc.)</p>
    <h3>Capturing interests as a part of profile setup would allow us to prioritize content as we continued to scale.</h3>
    <h3>User Interviews also helped shed light on the various challenges that parents faced.</h3>
    <p>As stated prior, parents have several questions about their child's diagnosis, and many times, they don't know where to turn to. Despite having resources like Google, Youtube, WeChat communities, etc., parents have no way of knowing what information is credible. Between work, chores, and their child's treatment, there's little time for anything really.

    <h3>As a part of this project, I helped introduce Design Thinking practices to the team.</h3>
    <p>I set up our company’s first Knowledge Board which was used to capture product assumptions and questions. This helped prevent unanswered questions from falling through the cracks and helped us plan for user research.
      <br><br>
      I also facilitated workshops with the design and product teams. These workshops included research synthesis meetings, as well as brainstorming design studios.</p>

    <h6>This is an affinity diagram from one of our research synthesis sessions. We organized our notes by question and used dot voting to focus our attention on the most important insights.</h6>
    <img src="/images/mybrightlink_8.png" alt="mybrightlink_8">
    <h6>Here are sketches from our brainstorming design studio. I drew inspiration from the Design Sprint when facilitating these brainstorming sessions.</h6>
    <h3>To make sure our design files were consistent with each other, another UI designer and myself worked on creating Sketch components.</h3>
    <p>The other UI designer and I split work on designing the high-fidelity mockups, but we were working in different time zones. We explored using Sketch components and styles to keep styling consistent across the board.
    </p>
    <h3>In order to aid in design handoff to engineering, I helped create a Text Style sheet with code-snippets. We also made sure to hand-off visual assets like icons, vector illustrations, and After Effects files.</h3>
    <p>To help make sure nothing was lost in translation, I helped Product Management in constructing dev stories. In addition to helping write some stories and including dev-ready Invision links, I would also include additional resources like annotated mockups, motion design examples from After Effects, and image assets.</p>

    <h3>To prepare for launch, I worked with product management to define event and property metrics.</h3>
    <p>Like every designer always says, “iterate, iterate, iterate!” By defining our data pool, we hoped we could open up opportunities for data analysis to inform future design decisions.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>myBrightlink was the second product I helped release into the market, and it taught me a lot about developing a product for the consumer space. There were many challenges that I faced throughout the process, but ultimately, it helped me grow into a better strategic thinker and overall designer.</p>
    <h3>Designers are responsible for A LOT, especially in smaller teams.</h3>
    <p>I’m no stranger to startup culture. However, this particular project had my hands in so many different places. UI design, user research, graphic design, motion design, web design, data analysis… it honestly felt overwhelming at times. Despite the amount of work, I can confidently say I’ve picked up a bunch of new skills. This project also taught me that designers need to do more than just “design”. Many times during this project, I found myself leading workshops, working to define product strategy, and defining short/long term project goals. As Digoenes Brito of Slack says, “[Designers] help your team by making ideas tangible.”</p>
    <h3>Be agile AND data-driven.</h3>
    <p>One of the biggest things I struggled with early on in my career was the shift from Design Thinking to Agile Product Development. I remember being extremely uncomfortable designing without any supporting data or insights. This led me to pick up the book “Lean UX” by Jeff Gothelf and pursue a certification as a SAFe (Agile) Practitioner. I introduced Knowledge Boards to track assumptions and questions, Design Studios to share the design process across teams, and Feature Hypotheses to design with a clear, aligned purpose.</p>
    <h3>Be comfortable with ambiguity, but plan when possible.</h3>
    <p>As in any project, there were things that would affect our project outside of my control. Whether that be shifting business priorities or team vacations, we had to be able to adjust on the fly. This taught me to have precautions in place and identify risks early. I made the shift from being reactive to proactive.</p>
    <h3>Looking back, I’d do things a little differently.</h3>
    <p>I realize now that we could’ve mitigated a lot of product risk by releasing a smaller product initially. Our initial release was very large with many features. I would’ve liked to release our product with the features that had highest value and lowest level of product risk. We would have been able to get real market feedback on our product, and we’d have more time to vet perceived value of our more high-risk features. 
      <br><br>
      I would also have liked to do a little more upfront market research. Of course the name of the game is agility, but I always err on the side of fleshing out user needs/project goals.</p>
